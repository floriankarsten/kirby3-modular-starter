# Kirby modular starter
Ongoing work.

Plain kirby theme that is based fully around site builder blocks. It's both starter to be remixed and good enough as it is.

It's developed every week live in streaming sessions https://floriankarsten.com/streaming

*Please post ideas for modules into github issues.*

## How to start
To install all dependencies. In root
```
npm install
cd htdocs
composer install
```

Then point your webserver to ```htodcs/public``` folder.

In package.json there are scripts to run most notably for watching development ```npm run dev``` and for building to production ```npm run build```.
